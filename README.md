# Medical Appointments Analysis

## Project Info:
This project used a Kaggle dataset with information from 100K medical appointments in Brazil that focused on whether the patient showed up for their appointment or were a no-show for their appointment. All of my analysis is saved in a Jupyter Notebook and has been exported as a HTML file for easier viewing.
